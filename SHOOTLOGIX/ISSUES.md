## ~~[P1] Missing confirmation dialogs for destructive delete actions~~ FIXED 2026-04-12
- **Fixed in**: fix/2026-04-12-missing-delete-confirmations
- **Details**: 4 assignment-remove functions (boats, picture boats, transport, security boats) and `fnbCellClear` now use `showConfirm()` before deleting

## [P1] Silent error handling in fuel machinery updates
- **Discovered**: 2026-04-12
- **Symptoms**: When updating fuel machinery type, if the PUT request fails, user gets no feedback — data appears updated in UI but silently fails on server
- **Likely cause**: catch block at ~line 6885 has `/* silent */` comment
- **Files involved**: `static/app-monolith.js`
- **Estimated effort**: Quick fix — replace silent catch with `toast('Error: ' + e.message, 'error')`

## [P1] Guard camp preload fails silently
- **Discovered**: 2026-04-12
- **Symptoms**: When guard camp data fails to load in background, user sees nothing — tab will be blank with no error message
- **Likely cause**: `.catch(() => {})` at ~line 9646 swallows errors
- **Files involved**: `static/app-monolith.js`
- **Estimated effort**: Quick fix

## [P0] Fleet/Crew sub-tab event handlers may not fire on cloned DOM
- **Discovered**: 2026-03-22
- **Symptoms**: When clicking Fleet > Picture Boats or Fleet > Security Boats, the sub-tab content is rendered in the original view panel. Interactive elements (drag-drop, inline edits) work because they use the original DOM, but the fleet sub-nav is injected via `prepend()` which may cause layout shifts.
- **Likely cause**: The fleet/crew unified tabs switch the active view panel rather than cloning content, so event handlers work. However, the injected sub-nav element is moved between panels on each sub-tab switch.
- **Files involved**: `static/app-monolith.js` (renderFleetUnified, renderCrewUnified)
- **Estimated effort**: Quick fix — may need to keep sub-nav in a fixed position outside view panels

## [P1] Picture Boats and Security Boats lists are empty
- **Discovered**: 2026-03-22
- **Symptoms**: `/api/productions/1/picture-boats` returns `[]`, `/api/productions/1/security-boats` returns `[]`. All boats are in the main boats table with category "picture".
- **Likely cause**: The data loader may not be seeding picture_boats and security_boats tables separately, or the boats were all created in the main `boats` table regardless of intended category.
- **Files involved**: `database.py`, `data_loader.py`, `app.py` (picture-boats/security-boats routes)
- **Estimated effort**: Medium — need to investigate data model and potentially migrate boats to correct tables

## [P1] Transport and Helpers lists are empty
- **Discovered**: 2026-03-22
- **Symptoms**: `/api/productions/1/transport` returns `[]`, `/api/productions/1/helpers` returns `[]` (but helper-assignments has data). No transport vehicles or helpers have been created.
- **Likely cause**: Data was never seeded for these modules, or they need to be created manually by users.
- **Files involved**: `database.py`, `data_loader.py`
- **Estimated effort**: Quick — may just need user to add data through the UI

## [P1] Fuel entries and machinery are empty
- **Discovered**: 2026-03-22
- **Symptoms**: `/api/productions/1/fuel-entries` returns `[]`, `/api/productions/1/fuel-machinery` returns `[]`
- **Likely cause**: No data seeded for fuel module
- **Files involved**: `database.py`
- **Estimated effort**: Quick — user needs to add data

## [P1] Guards list is empty
- **Discovered**: 2026-03-22
- **Symptoms**: `/api/productions/1/guards` returns `[]` but guard-posts has data (1643 bytes)
- **Likely cause**: Guards need to be created separately from guard posts
- **Files involved**: `database.py`
- **Estimated effort**: Quick

## [P2] Module files in static/modules/ are dead code
- **Discovered**: 2026-03-22
- **Symptoms**: Files like `fleet.js`, `crew.js`, `today.js`, `documents.js`, etc. in `static/modules/` reference `window._SL` which doesn't exist. They are never loaded by `index.html`.
- **Likely cause**: These were written for a module-loading system that was never implemented in the monolith. The equivalent functionality has now been added directly to `app-monolith.js`.
- **Files involved**: All files in `static/modules/`
- **Estimated effort**: Quick cleanup — these files could be removed or kept for reference
